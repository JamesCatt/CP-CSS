# CP CSS
An extension for ExpressionEngine 3 that allows the user to easily add custom CSS to the Control Panel.

## Installation
1. Place the `cpcss` folder in your `/user/addons` directory.
2. Install from the Add-On Manager menu in the Control Panel.
3. Open the CP CSS settings, and either enter your custom CSS directly in the first field, or a URL to a CSS file in the second field (this will override any CSS in the first field). There are two sets of fields for use with MSM.
4. Enjoy!

## Note on MSM use
Currently there are two sets of fields for use with two MSM sites. This is because MSM doesn't support separate settings for extensions on different sites. Conversion to a full module with proper MSM support is planned for a future release.
