# CP CSS
An extension for ExpressionEngine 3 that allows the user to easily add custom CSS to the Control Panel.

## Installation
1. Place the `cpcss` folder in your `/user/addons` directory.
2. Install from the Add-on Manager menu in the Control Panel.
3. Open the CP CSS settings, and either enter your custom CSS directly in the first field, or a URL to a CSS file in the second field (this will override any CSS in the first field).
4. Enjoy!
